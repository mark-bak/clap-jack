Card Game Simulation

Simulates an odd card game that I have been asked about once....

card_game.py    provides classes to simulate the game and quickly create players with differing strategies,
                a range of created players and their performance is also present,

perfect.py      finds out the theoretical ideal limit on points you could acheive if you could see the future,
